<h2>Following Along WittCode's HapiJS Tutorial Series on YT</h2>

This tutorial is vast in how much it covers and explains alot of the basics of HapiJS's ecosystem, including its many plugins which allow for validation/authentication (still doesn't use Joi, will be looking into this, promise). While following webdevsimplified's course on ExpressJS Authentication, I recognized that much of the syntax for authentication regarding Authentication in HapiJS was drastically different and I was glad to find a recent tutorial series by a YouTuber named WittCode.

The documents here are a bit messy but cover the basics of HapiJS in more detail than i was previously familiar with. In addition he also briefly covers the Database ORM Sequelize and how to set up a basic connection with GET and POST requests (not PUT or DELETE though...).

The link for the tutorial series can be found <a style=color:#00ae8cff href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkqiWyX-_LotaQ9AuppIAXl0xyV-P5Ms-">here.</a>
